# Hashing-Techniques
Hashing is one of the efficient technique used to perform dictionary operations such as insert, search, delete. This technique uses hash tables to implement. Hash table is usually an array with index and stores the values according the values generated by the hash function.
This hashing technique is implemented with the help of python programming language.

Here we use a simple python program for linear and double probing hashing techniques.
